# Macro replacement

Adapted from the CPPGM Foundation macro handout (2013). This is part of
[the complete preprocessor assignment](README.md), using its file interface
and error contract. A token stream containing an invalid phase-7 token is an
error even if macro expansion itself succeeded.


Once you have executed phase 1-3 as per PA1 `pptoken` to produce a sequence of `preprocessing-tokens`, you will divide them into preprocessing directives and `text-sequences`.

Preprocessing directives can be identified by their prefix, one of:

    start-of-file #
    start-of-file whitespace-sequence #
    new-line #
    new-line whitespace-sequence #

Where `start-of-file` denotes the beginning of the token sequence.

Any of these patterns must start a preprocessing directive.  The preprocessing directive is terminated by the next `new-line`.

The macro group starts with definitions and undefinitions. Conditional inclusion
and the other directives are specified in [directives.md](directives.md).

    // object-like macros
	# define identifier new-line
	# define identifier must-whitespace replacement-list new-line
	
	// function-like macros
	# define identifier no-whitespace ( ) replacement-list new-line
	# define identifier no-whitespace ( identifier-list ) replacement-list new-line
	# define identifier no-whitespace ( ... ) replacement-list new-line
	# define identifier no-whitespace ( identifier-list , ... ) replacement-list new-line

    // undefine macro
	# undef identifier new-line
	
`no-whitespace` means that there is no `whitespace-sequence` between the two adjacent tokens.  `must-whitespace` means there _must_ be a `whitespace-sequence` between the two adjacent tokens. Otherwise `whitespace-sequence` may optionally appear between any tokens.

A `replacement-list` is a possibly empty sequence of any `preprocessing-tokens` apart from `new-line`.

An `identifier-list` is a comma-separated sequence of `identifiers`.

`#define` directives define macros, `#undef` directives undefine them.

A `text-sequence` is a maximal sequence of tokens that is not part of a preprocessing directive.

Each `text-sequence` must be macro replaced using the currently defined set of macros at that point in the file.  Once this has been done the macro replaced `preprocessing-tokens` should be processed by phase 5-7 as per PA2 `posttoken` and output.

The rules for macro replacement are described in section _16.3 Macro Replacement_ of the standard.

Course-defined: when the result of a `##` operator is not a single valid preprocessing token (16.3.3p3 leaves the behavior undefined), the source file is rejected with `EXIT_FAILURE`.

> If the name of the macro being replaced is found during this scan of the replacement list (not including the
rest of the source file’s preprocessing tokens), it is not replaced. Furthermore, if any nested replacements
encounter the name of the macro being replaced, it is not replaced. These nonreplaced macro name preprocessing
tokens are no longer available for further replacement even if they are later (re)examined in contexts
in which that macro name preprocessing token would otherwise have been replaced.

We shall course-define two invocations X and Y to be nested with respect to each other if the head macro name `identifier` token of Y was part of the replaced tokens of the X invocation.  This nestedness relationship shall not survive parameter substitution:

    #define f(x) 1 g(x)
    #define g(x) 2 f(x)
    
    f(f(x))
    
The trace of the above is:

    f(f(x))
    f(1 g(x))
    f(1 2 f(x))
    1 g(1 2 f(x))
    1 2 f(1 2 f(x))

However a macro name token that is not replaced due to nesting is never replaced again, even after substitution as:

    #define z z[0]
    #define f(x) 1 x
    
    f(z)
    
The trace is:

    f(z)
    f(z[0])
    1 z[0]

z remains unavailable for invocation even after it is substituted in a parameter.

Finally we show:

    #define f(x) 1 x
    #define g(x) 2 x

    g(f)(g)(3)

The trace is:

    g(f)(g)(3)
    2 f(g)(3)  <-- f is nested with respect to g as the token is part of the previous g invocation
    2 1 g(3)   <-- g is nested with respect to f, therefore it is not replaced (g -> f -> g)

Note that this course-defined interpretation of the nesting semantics is not necessarily the same one used by all other preprocessors (in particular gcc).

## Design notes (optional)

As usual these design notes only describe one possible way to do this assignment, and are entirely optional.

First of all, it is recommended that you read 16.3 a couple of times before you continue reading these notes, and certainly before you start writing code.  Some find the logic of macro replacement quite challenging to implement, so be prepared for this.

You can start by making a `PreprocessingToken` class that packs up the output of `IPPTokenStream`.

Perform a simple top-down predictive parse to get a stream of preprocessing directives and `text-sequences`.

Keep a table of currently defined macros.

When you encounter a `#define` add the macro to the table.  If it currently exists check to see that the `identifier-list` and `replacement-list` is the same as the currently defined one.  It is an error if they do not match.

When you encounter an `#undef` remove the macro from the table.

When you encounter a `text-sequence` you need to process any macro invocations it contains.

As a first step note that `new-lines` are not significant once a `text-sequence` has been identified, so you can collapse `new-lines` into `whitespace-sequence` at this point.  After that you will also want to collapse each resulting contiguous sequences of `whitespace-sequences` into a singular `whitespace-sequence`.

As you find macro invocations you will invoke them and replace the invocation with a new sequence of tokens.  These new tokens have to be _rescanned_.

Consider the following:

	#define f(x) 1 x (
	#define g(x) 2 x
	f(g)b)

The `text-sequence` is as follows:

    f(g)b)
    
After the first invocation `f(g)` is replaced by `1 g (` resulting in:

    1 g (b)
    
This must be rescanned, and a new invocation is found.  That of `g (b)`, which is replaced by `2 b`:

    1 2 b
    
Given the nature of that operation, a good data structure to use is a stack, where the top of the stack is the start of the text sequence (ie token order is in reverse).  That way when an invocation is replaced, its tokens can be popped off the top of the stack and the replacement list can be pushed onto it, and processing can continue from the top of the stack again.

This is the clearest way to see rescanning. On a standard library header a `text-sequence` can run to thousands of lines; the [README's "Later scale" section](README.md#later-scale) describes a shape that gives the same tokens without holding the whole sequence.

After you identify a function-like macro invocation and its arguments, there are three possible transformations you may need to perform on each argument before they are used:

- the argument is used as is
- the argument is macro replaced before being used
- the argument is stringized

Which of the three options is applied depends on the usage of the parameter within the `replacement-list` of the macro.  If it follows a `#`, the argument is stringized.  If it is next to a `##` the argument is used as is.  If neither, than it is macro replaced before being used.

The rules for nesting and recursion are difficult to understand, and even more difficult to implement.

We suggest keeping with each identifier token, a blacklist of nested macro names and a noninvokable flag.  When an identifier token is produced as part of a macro invocation its blacklist is assigned to be that of the head token of the macro that was just invoked, and also the name of the macro that was used is added.

Once you have identified a new potential macro invocation, check to see if the heads name is contained in its own blacklist, if it is flag it as noninvokable.  If the head token is flagged as noninvokable, abort the invocation.

### Blue painting guidance (optional)

The usual way to implement the recursion rule is called _blue painting_.  The
important idea is that recursion state belongs to individual tokens, not to the
preprocessor as a whole.

Give each preprocessing token a small set of macro names that are unavailable
for that token.  If an identifier token named `F` has `F` in its unavailable
set, it is emitted as an ordinary identifier and is not expanded as macro `F`.
The unavailable mark stays with that token if the token is later rescanned.

When a macro invocation is replaced, identifier tokens that come from that
macro's own replacement list become unavailable for the macro currently being
expanded.  They should also preserve any unavailable names already carried by
the macro-name token that caused this expansion.  This is what makes direct and
indirect recursive macros stop without using a global recursion cutoff.

The result must be as if the replacement tokens were rescanned together with
the source tokens that follow them, before anything later is emitted: a
replacement list can create a new macro invocation using tokens that follow it
in the original source.

Function-like macro arguments need one extra distinction:

- collect arguments as raw preprocessing tokens before expanding them
- stringized parameters use the raw argument
- parameters next to `##` use the raw argument
- ordinary substituted parameters use the macro-expanded argument

The paint acquired while expanding an argument stays on those argument tokens
when they are substituted.  However, those substituted tokens should not be
treated as if they were written directly in the current macro's replacement
list; parameter substitution breaks the nesting relationship described above.

For `##`, the result of pasting the raw spellings is retokenized and rescanned
(simply appending the pasted spelling to the output is wrong): a pasted
identifier may name a macro, and the rescan is what decides whether it
expands.  The pasted spelling must form exactly one preprocessing token;
otherwise the source file is rejected (a course rule; see above).
